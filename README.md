# CS50 WEB PROGRAMMING FINAL PROJECT: CV SPARK


This Learning Journey with CS50W was so great !.As a guy who only knew some python i got to learn many things about Django and Javascript i would first like to Thank Whole CS50W Crew


When it came to my Final Project i was determined to make something that would be useful .. So i came to the idea of a CV generator app

## APP IDEA

My App takes in User Data and converts it into a CV format which Users can download and apply to Jobs 



## Libraries Used


xhtml2pdf i used this python library to convert html template to a pdf format

## Key Features

-Register/Login/Logout 

-Profile Section -I made use of Django Signals in my models.py where  i made a feature that connected to User Model .Whenever a User Creates a Account a Profile is generated  for the user prepopulated with details like username email and others which can be edited.I made use of Javascript to add a User experience by adding Toggling feature where i can toggle between Edit Profile and my Profile Details .

-Create Section  -This is the place where User can enter the details that they need to add in thier CV i made use of Javascript to add a custom client side validation to bootstrap form 

-Cvs Section This is the place where CV in pdf form will be generated  users have the option to view the CV which will show them content of the  details they submited  in a CV Format if they like the format they can Download the CV by clicking Download button.Users can also delete thier CV from the list. I made use of Javascript to add a Upvote system where users can upvote other users CVs similar to like feature.


-Team Section This is section where Users can browse through different fields Where they can join Teams like Web Developer,Cybersecurity etc . On joining Users will be able to see other people and thier CVs who are aleready in the Team helping Users to understand key skills needed in thier respective fields


-Jobs Sections  Here i made use of apis from both server side and from client side i used Adzuna api in my views and i added unsplash photos api to match the image with the job offered in my Javascript Code


## Distinctiveness and Complexity

In terms of Distinctivenes this project is entirely different from other projects i had made. i even tried adding Django Features like Signals making use of api calls  from other websites in both server side and client side. i kept in mind of all things i had learned through the entire course and applied most of the concepts i learned in this project. i also had to do some research on the xhtml2pdf python package 
  
This project contains about 5 models and made use of all 3 relations OnetoOne OnetoMany and ManytoMany  i have made use of relation between the models to acheive various features like for example the upvote system and i also have made use js code  for client side manipulation in most of my template so the project is quite Complex
